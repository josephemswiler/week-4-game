# Street Fighter
Street Fighter is a simple turn-based role-playing game (RPG) modeled after the prolific arcade game Street Fighter II. The goal is to defeat all players until just one player remains: the winner! You may use the same player to achieve victory or use a different player each round. The strategy lies in selecting a player to maximize your chance of victory each round based on the remaining players you need to defeat. Each player has a different amount of hit points and a different maximum attack; this makes each player strategic in different ways! The measure of success is the number of rounds it takes to complete the game. Defeat a player each round for the best score possible!
